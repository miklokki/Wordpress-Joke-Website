# Wordpress-Joke-Website
My first Wordpress site 
I will give the code to anyone who wants it
A locally hosted site where you can view and add jokes
Wordpress plugins used: Elementor, Ocean Extra, User Registration, WPCode

How it functions: Jokes are added to and read from the database with some manual php code by using the WPCode snippet plugin.

ToDo: 1. Manually add a star rating system to the "View Jokes"-page. 2. Hide menu bars depending on if the user is logged in or not.
