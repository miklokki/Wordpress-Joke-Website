# Wordpress-Joke-Website <br />
My first Wordpress site <br />
I will give the code to anyone who wants it<br />
A locally hosted site where you can view and add jokes<br />
Wordpress plugins used: Elementor, Ocean Extra, User Registration, WPCode<br />

How it functions: Jokes are added to and read from the database with some manual php code by using the WPCode snippet plugin.<br />

ToDo: 1. Manually add a star rating system to the "View Jokes"-page. 2. Hide menu bars depending on if the user is logged in or not.<br />
